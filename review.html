	<h1>Web Hosting Review</h1>
	<p>The following show the coparsion between three different web hosting providers.</p>
	
	<h2>Host <a href = "https://bluehost.com">Bluehost</a></h2>
	
	<p>The hosting compeny Bluehost offers many different types of services ranging from a full-service wedsite to a SEO Service.  All of this strarts off with a base of $2.95 and goes up to $15. It is unclear what is being offered with in the different opitions.</p>
	
	<h2>Host <a href = "https://godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a></h2>
	
	<p>The hosting compeny GoDaddy offers three different opitions for the user.  Their basic opition starts off at $1 and that allows for 1 wedsite, 100GB storage, 24/7 security monitoring, and more.  The other two opitions have the same with a few changes and more opitions and goes up to $14. The main website clerly list what the customer are paying for.  </p>
	
	<h2>Host <a href = "https://hostgator.com">HostGator</a></h2>
	
	<p>This hosting provider also has three dirfferent opitions for their comstuor to choose from. The choices are almost the same as GoDaddy and starts at $2.75 going to $6; however, it is a little unclear of what it is that the customer paying for, even though it shows a little of what is within the opition. </p>
	
	<h2>The Choice</h2>
	
	<p>After look at the three different hosting providers, I would choose GoDaddy this is do for the understanding that you know what you are getting.  </p>
