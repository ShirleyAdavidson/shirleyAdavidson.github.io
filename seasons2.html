				Season’s Spell
				</p>
				<p>
					Leafless branches; stark against blue;
				</p>	
				<p>Dormant and waiting, the trunk's a dark hue,
					</p>	
				<p>Bark all closed off, not wasting heat
					</p>	
				<p>Roots search frozen ground for something to eat.

					</p>	
				<p>Up comes a wind, graciously warm,
					</p>	
				<p>Soil unclenches its hard, molded grasp,
					</p>	
				<p>Old roots finally can change their form,
					</p>	
				<p>New buds shoot out like a long-held-in gasp.

					</p>	
				<p>Leaves keep growing, young branch sprouts start,
					</p>	
				<p>Only sky seen is when canopy parts,
					</p>	
				<p>Bug on a leaf – now a bird's bite,
					</p>	
				<p>Tree photosynthesizes the gold sunlight.

					</p>	
				<p>A chill creeps in, green turns to gold,
					</p>	
				<p>The last Barred owl hoots its last “who”,
					</p>	
				<p>As down fall the leaves that now have grown old,
					</p>	
				<p>Leafless branches; stark against blue.
