			<h2>
				A Kid’s Life
			</h2>
			<p>
				Rain coming down sometimes making floods,
			</p>	
			<p>Sometimes turning dirt into mud,
			</p>	
			<p>	Watering plants making grass grow,
				</p>	
			<p>Then suddenly turning into snow,
				</p>	
			<p>The white blanket comes down on the ground,
				</p>	
			<p>Covering houses and cars without a sound,
				</p>	
			<p>Children sledding down in the snow,
				</p>	
			<p>They want to throw snowballs at cars but parents say
				no.

				</p>	
			<p>Then turning into sunshine kids run out to play,
				</p>	
			<p>It’s summer – hurray!
				</p>	
			<p>Football games at the park,
				</p>	
			<p>Until it starts to get dark,
				</p>	
			<p>Then everyone runs out of sight,
				</p>	
			<p>Having sleepovers and stay up till 12 at night,
				</p>	
			<p>They wake up in morning to some toast,
				</p>	
			<p>Everyone tries to eat the most,
				</p>	
			<p>They all get sick,
				</p>	
			<p>Two of the kids run to each find a stick,
				</p>	
			<p>They have a sword fight,
				</p>	
			<p>Then the rest of the day,
				</p>	
			<p>They run and play,
				</p>	
			<p>Until
				</p>	
			<p>time to come in
				</p>	
			<p>their parents say.

				</p>	
			<p>They wake up to a fright,
				</p>	
			<p>There’s leaves coming down all around,
				</p>	
			<p>They must have come at night,
				</p>	
			<p>They go outside then they hear their mom,

				</p>	
			<p>Come on its time for a hayride!

				</p>	
			<p>Then Halloween comes, everyone dresses up,
				</p>	
			<p>After they see all the candy,
				</p>	
			<p>They smile with glee,
				</p>	
			<p>The parents say
				</p>	
			<p>brush your teeth don’t get a cavity,
				</p>	
			<p>You answer back
				</p>	
			<p>but I already have three.

				</p>	
			<p>You wake up in the middle of the night,
				</p>	
			<p>You’ve had a quite a scare,
				</p>	
			<p>A horrible nightmare,
				</p>	
			<p>But you realize it’s just a dream,
				</p>	
			<p>But then you seem to think of whip cream,
				</p>	
			<p>You wake up and the whip cream from your dream,
				</p>	
			<p>Has turned into snow.
