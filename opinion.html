				The world wildlife website for elephants allows readers to get a lot of information regarding these fabulous animals. The overall website is clean and easy to follow. The website has links to many others regarding people who are experts on elephants and wildlife conservation. Along with these links there are links to other pages regarding information about elephants. When comparing this website to the others I find it to be very inviting for the reader. Some little things that the site has that makes it stand out from the others is that there is a map showing where the two different types of elephants live. Along with current articles about different relevant events like the aftermath of China as it bans the ivory trade.

				The navigation menu on the site underlines what part of the page you are on allowing the reader to know what they are looking at as the title on some sections is not in view. Each section of the page has a different background color making it easy for the reader to know when they have moved to the next section. The main colors that are used are black, white, and gray; with a little orange and blue text for things that are linked to a different page or website. There are widgets that are linked to facebook, instagram, and youtube. When looking at the code for this site it is easy to follow. The developers are using what looks like the current version of html, along with the use of script.

				For someone who does any type of sewing Nancy's Notions has a great website for everything one would need. The website is easy to navigate and gives great detail in what is on each page. You are able to search within the site making it easy to find what you are looking for. The site has different links to different places throughout the site and has a place where you are able to buy items off the site. When looking at the website link at the top it has the lock symbol which means that your information is safe.

				The overall website is very clean and refreshing. When looking at the site the main colors that are used are white and a light gray. Within the site there are many different pictures giving a different way of looking for something within the site. As there are a lot of photos it is not overwhelming. When hovering over the navigation menu there is a sub menu that pops up allowing for a more specific menu under each main menu. When looking at the code for this site there are a lot of different sections and uses of script within the code. When trying to see if they are using the current version of html it was not clear.

			<h1>
				<a href = "https://www.sandiegocremationservice.com/">Bad</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				In general this website is my least favorite out of the three because it is plain. When going through the website it looks like a standard html set up. The information on the site is confusing to follow and as someone who knows what the site is talking about it is still hard to understand exactly what is going on. This site does not have a lot of information within the site. As the main colors do flow together, there is a column on the side that does not match the upper colors. On the page labeled forms there are about 10 different links for different forms but when looking at them it is not clear what they are really for. The site needs to have more detail regarding what they are. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The overall website is plain and does not have a lot to give to the reader.  This makes the site seem to be a front for fake company. The site has little links outside the website. When going to the different pages the writing makes it so that there is no personalization. There are different links within the site to facebook and twitter. However, This information is on every page making it so that it is in your face this does not sit well within the reader. When looking at the code in the developers tool it does not seem to be using the current version of html.
