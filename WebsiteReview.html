				Overall
			</header>
			
			<p>
				All of the websites have a really good color plate that flows throuhgout all the different pages.  They all have a variety of images and links to other sources. When trying to find the same thing on each wabsite on some it was on the first page and for others it took a little bit of looking.

				1. <a href = "https://www.vermont.gov/">Vermont</a>
			</header>
			
			<p>
				After Looking at all the different websites, the website for Vermont I found to be the best.  I think this because I like how the site looks and the convince how fast the site loads. The thing I was looking for was right on the first page. There are many links to different parts of the site and exteral refences to different jobs and where to take a vacation.

				2. <a href = "https://www.tn.gov/">Tennessee</a>
			</header>
			
			<p>
				The website for Tennessee is really nice. I am a fan of the changing banner that links to different atricles on the site.  The thing I was looking for took a little time to find, but was on the page. It shows the different types of things that I think people would look for when trying to look into a state.

				3. <a href = "https://alaska.gov/">Alaska</a>
			</header>	
			
			<p>
				When looking at the webite for Alaska it was very informative giving great details on the economy and lastest news within Alaska. There are great links to the a calander and different highlights activies that can be done. The thing I was looking for was right on the first page.

				4. <a href = "https://www.ok.gov/">Oklahoma</a>
			</header>
			
			<p>
				For Oklahoma the website is a little plain.  There is not as much infromation on this site, but there are links to different sites giving the apperence that they do not need to have the information on their site.  The thing I was looking for took a little time to find, but was on the page.

				5. <a href = "https://www.iowa.gov/">Iowa</a>
			</header>

			<p>
				Iowa's website is my least favorite and this is due to how the website is laid out.  The site is really zoomed in and isn't visually appealing. It is very blockly with white text.  The different colors can work well together, but on this site it does not flow well together. The thing I was looking for was right on the first page.
